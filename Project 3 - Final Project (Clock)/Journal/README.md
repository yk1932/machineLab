Project Description
What this project is, how it will operate in the context of the clock, and an overall picture (hand-drawn or CAD)
Your journal is a record of your work on this project from the first drawings that were due on April 6.
I want to see the progression from the first rough sketches to the design that you have now.
Describe the changes that you make to your design and why you make them
Discuss the various things you learned on the way.
Discuss the difficulties you ran into, and how you resolved them
Discuss how you decided which piece to fabricate by 3D printing, which pieces to fabricate by cutting with the laser cutter, and any other tools
Discuss how your mechanism will be assembled
Discuss what other components or materials you will need when the project is assembled
Discuss any remaining problems or concerns
