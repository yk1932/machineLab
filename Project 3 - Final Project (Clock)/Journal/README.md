### Part One: Project Description

The Machine Lab final project is a group project between the instructor, Michael Shiloh, and students of NYU Abu Dhabi. The final product is a clock, which will be displayed in the Art Center, for the public to view. The theme of the clock is hobbies. Each student selected one of their favorite activities and designed a mechanism inspired from it. As there are 10 students and 1 instructor, each hour will be dedicated to one mechanism. At the final hour, 12, the mechanisms will perform all together. The instructions will be coded into and controlled by an Arduino. The overall idea of the mechanism is shown in the sketch below:

### Part Two: Changes Made

In the design process of the mechanism, there were several changes that were made. 

1. Activity Type: In the process, the type of activity was changed, as shown in the development journal. This choice was made due to a change in desire to mechanize a personal and meaningful activity, not something that would merely be fun to mechanize physically. 

2. Final Product Type (Shift to Fusion 360): With the emergence of the CO-VID19 situation, the class had to shift to online remote learning. With this, the potential of making a physical final product became unclear. The initial material type (metal) and aesthetic choices I planned for this project had to shift with this change. Also, the process of prototyping changed significantly, in a positive way. Prior to fusion 360, the only method of prototyping I was familiar with was through cardboard. However, Fusion360 gave me another option for prototyping - more intricate and appropriate for testing more complicated mechanisms. 

### Part Three: Things Learnt / Difficulties

One valuable takeaway from this project was the realizing design processes which works and does not work for me. Ideation and designing came much more easier and naturally when I actually had physical contact with it. For example, hand-drawn sketches for ideation, hand-written brainstorm sessions, physical mechanisms. Hence, although Fusion360 had more options and functions, it took me time to adapt to this digital platform where the physical component of the mechanism was removed entirely. I learnt that the physical aspect of a product, in the development process, played a big role in the process of comprehending the product and developing it further. As such, digital softwares such as Fusion360 is something I will use to construct an already refined idea and design. But, it wonâ€™t be the platform I use in the initial developing stage as it does not work for me personally. 

Although it did not last long, the workshop training taught me about the resources we had access to. Having been through the basic training, that exposure, inspired me to take advantage of such resources in my future projects. It is a skill I certainly want to develop further if given the opportunity. 

Fusion360: Working with this platform taught me the importance of knowing dimensions in advance. I think this was the hardest part for me. Because it was on a digital platform, visualizing some dimensions, did not come naturally to me. However, I realized that with bigger mechanisms, having these exact dimensions was essential prior to constructing them to reduce the number of errors and resources. 

Another thing I learnt personally was that I struggle to design a mechanism purely for functional purposes. I had this realization with the previous project as well, with the giraffe. I put as much effort into, or even more, making sure the mechanism looked and was presented well. When I am not personally satisfied by a particular design, I struggle to care about the intricate details and functionalities of the mechanism. Perfecting the aesthetics is almost a pre-requisite to moving the project forward. This is something I have to work on, especially in classes like these, as perfecting and caring about the little details and functionality of a mechanism is also an essential part of the creation process. I am not sure how I will change my mindset but it is something I recognized as a potential issue and worth working on. 

### Part Four: Discuss how you decided which piece to fabricate by 3D printing, which pieces to fabricate by cutting with the laser cutter, and any other tools

Pieces appropriate for 3D printing were pieces with more organic, less rigid shapes. In other words, pieces that could not be cut simply with a laser cutter. However, I tried to use as much flat pieces, even in constructing three dimensional figures, to simplify the construction process. 

### Part Five: Assembling Mechanism

The fan will be 3D printed, most likely from a pre-existing CAD file, with a support system for the servo motor. The flat pieces of the person and the watermelon will be laser cut and assembled in person. The basic frame and cam mechanism will also be laser cut and assembled in person. 

### Part Six: Other Components required

Other components required would be bolts and nuts, arduino (to bring mechanism alive).
